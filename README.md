# ReelStream

## Concept
A web application that prompts a user to search for a movie and returns:

* General information about the movie (title, director, plot)
* An embedded video player to view the movie's trailer
* Where to stream the movie online (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, etc.)
* Recommendations for related movies

### Process:
* UI was primarily built through Materialize.css
* JS uses multiple nested functions and four unique API calls to fetch search result data
* APIs used: YouTube, UTelly, OMDB, TMDB
